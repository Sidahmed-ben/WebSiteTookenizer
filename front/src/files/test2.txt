In this example, we are defining a condition using a string variable (condition) that will be used in the WHERE clause of our SELECT statement. You can customize this condition to fit your specific needs.

We then use SQLAlchemy to execute our query, passing the condition variable into the SELECT statement using an f-string. The fetchall() method is used to return all rows from the query result as a list of tuples.
